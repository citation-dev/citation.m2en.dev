```kt
Logger.sendInfo("Start reading location settings ....")
val localizationFunction = ResourceBundleLocalizationFunction
.fromBundles("CitationCommands", DiscordLocale.ENGLISH_US, DiscordLocale.UKRAINIAN)
.build()
Logger.sendInfo("Location settings loaded.")
```

- See JDA's JavaDoc for `DiscordLocale` definition.
  - [Enum DiscordLocale - JDA JavaDoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.dv8tion/JDA/latest/net/dv8tion/jda/api/interactions/DiscordLocale.html)

2. add language properties

- Add a language property file with the file name `CitationCommands_<locale>.propertices`.
  - The `locale` can be found by jumping to the `DiscordLocale` definition.
- **Add translations for all commands**.
  - Incomplete translations will not be merged into the `main` branch.
- Check ["configuration file"](#configuration file) for how to write.
